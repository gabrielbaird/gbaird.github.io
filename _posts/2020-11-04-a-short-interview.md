<i><b>Gabriel:</b> Describe your personality in three plants or less.</i>


<b>Scientist:</b>
<b>Behind the Safeway on 99</b>

The crocuses are waiting where they always wait, all curled up against swollen bulbs.
Later, when the snow comes, they will push their blunt, fierce heads up through it, 
quiet violet hopefuls in an empty woods. Now, though, the blackberries stumble 
rampant over the landscape, their vines glutted with berries, heavy and fat.

<i><b>Gabriel:</b> If your inner spirit had a form, what it would be?</i>

<b>Scientist:</b>

Early in the 90s you found a seedpod on the path in the botanical gardens. 
You took it home and you baked it until the cone opened up its many mouths 
to let its seeds fall out. You did everything right: one seedling grew in your southern widow, 
its soil always damp and thick with compost. Leaves poured out, but never flowers.

You never thought it would flower. It was an Outdoor Plant, 
and even the best window seat in the whole country can't rival 
the sun and the sea on the Cape of Good Hope. Instead, you 
built it into a bonsai, kengai style. You raised the cascade 
like you raised your kids, equal parts strain and benign neglect. 
It was a project.

You never thought it would flower, but last Tuesday it did.
